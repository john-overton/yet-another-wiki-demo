# Importing Pages

The wiki provides a built-in page import feature that allows you to add existing markdown files to your documentation. This functionality is accessible through the import modal interface.

## Features

* **Markdown Support**: Import any valid markdown (.md) files into your wiki
* **Location Selection**: Choose where to place imported pages:
  * Root level (top of the hierarchy)
  * Under any existing page
* **Simple Interface**: User-friendly modal with file selection and location dropdown
* **Validation**: Ensures only markdown files are selected

:::caution
Images in imported Markdown documents may break if they are not publicly available links.  It may be necessary to re-upload your images in the page editor after you import the document.
