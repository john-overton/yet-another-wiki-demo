# Trash Bin

The Trash Bin is where your deleted pages are stored temporarily. This allows you to recover pages that were deleted accidentally or view their content before permanent deletion.

* Its title
* Its original location in the wiki
* Options to preview or permanently delete it

1. Select the pages you want to restore by checking the boxes next to them
2. Choose where you want to restore the pages to:
   * Select "Root (Top Level)" to restore pages to the main wiki level
   * Or select any existing page to restore them as child pages
3. Click the "Restore Selected" button

## Previewing Content

Before restoring a page, you can preview its content:

1. Click the eye icon (üëÅÔ∏è) next to the page you want to preview
2. The page content will appear below the list
3. Click the X button to close the preview

## Permanent Deletion

To permanently delete a page from the trash bin:

1. Click the trash icon (üóëÔ∏è) next to the page
2. Note: This action cannot be undone - the page will be permanently removed
