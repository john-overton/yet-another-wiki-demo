# Backup and Restore

The backup and restore functionality allows you to create complete backups of your wiki and restore them when needed. This feature is crucial for data safety and system recovery.

## What's Included in Backups

A backup includes all essential components of your wiki:

* All wiki content and pages
* Database contents
* Public files and uploads
* System configuration
* User settings and preferences

## Creating a Backup

To create a backup:

1. Navigate to Settings
2. Locate the "Backup & Import" section
3. Click the "Create Backup" button
4. The system will generate a ZIP file containing all your data
5. The file will automatically download to your computer
6. Store this backup file in a secure location

### Best Practices for Backups

* Create regular backups, especially before:
  * Making major content changes
  * Updating the system
  * Modifying system configurations
* Keep multiple backup versions
* Store backups in different physical locations
* Label backups with dates for easy identification
* Test your backups periodically by performing test restores

## Restoring from a Backup

To restore your wiki from a backup:

1. Navigate to Settings
2. Locate the "Backup & Import" section
3. Click the "Import Backup" button
4. Select your backup ZIP file
5. Confirm the restore operation

### ⚠️ Important Warnings

Before performing a restore:

* **Data Replacement**: Importing a backup will completely replace ALL existing content:
  * All current wiki pages
  * Database contents
  * Configuration settings
  * User data
  * Uploaded files
* **Irreversible Action**: This process cannot be undone
* **System Downtime**: The restore process may take several minutes, during which the wiki will be unavailable
* **Backup Current State**: Consider creating a backup of your current system state before performing a restore

### Safety Checklist Before Restore

1. ✓ Verify you have the correct backup file
2. ✓ Create a backup of your current system state
3. ✓ Ensure no users are actively using the system
4. ✓ Have sufficient disk space for the restore operation
5. ✓ Plan for potential system downtime

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

* **Backup Creation Fails**:
  * Check available disk space
  * Ensure you have proper permissions
  * Try creating smaller partial backups if needed
* **Restore Fails**:
  * Verify the backup file isn't corrupted
  * Check if the backup file format is correct
  * Ensure sufficient disk space for restore
  * Check system permissions

## Best Practices for System Administrators

1. **Regular Backups**:
   * Implement a regular backup schedule
   * Automate the backup process if possible
   * Verify backup integrity regularly
2. **Backup Storage**:
   * Keep backups in multiple locations
   * Use secure storage solutions
   * Implement proper access controls
3. **Documentation**:
   * Keep records of backup dates
   * Document any custom configurations
   * Maintain restore procedures
4. **Testing**:
   * Regularly test restore procedures
   * Verify backup integrity
   * Practice recovery scenarios
