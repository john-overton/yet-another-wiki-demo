# Yet Another Wiki 🙃

*"Because the world needed another wiki platform... said no one ever."*

And yet here we are! Born from the wild idea that maybe, just maybe, documentation shouldn't require a computer science degree to maintain. Crazy, right?

## What's This All About? 🤔

Yet Another Wiki is like that friend who's really good at organizing stuff but doesn't make a big deal about it. Built with Next.js and inspired by the cool kids (looking at you, Nextra, Docusaurus, and Bookstack), we took the best parts and made them accessible to everyone – yes, even Bob from accounting who still double-clicks hyperlinks.

## Features That Actually Matter 💫

#### Content Creation Made Human 📝

* Rich text editing powered by [MDXEditor](https://mdxeditor.dev/) (because markdown is great, but options are better)

* Nest pages like you're organizing your thoughts
* Private pages for your secret documentation stash
* Custom URLs that don't look like keyboard smashes

#### Looks Pretty, Works Better 🎨

* Light mode for the morning people
* Dark mode for the night owls
* Custom theming that actually makes sense
* Plays nice with your existing website
* Headers, footers, and logos? Yeah, we got those

#### Seriously Smart Stuff 🧠

* Table of contents that builds itself (magic! ✨)
* Book-style navigation (remember books?)
* Search that would make Algolia proud
* Mobile-friendly because it's not 1999
* Tailwind + Bootstrap included (use either, we don't judge)

#### Because Life Happens 🛟

* Import/backup right in the app (no server-side shenanigans required)
* Trash bin for those "oops" moments
* Import your old docs (because starting from scratch is overrated)
* Open source and extensible (if you're into that sort of thing)

## Pricing That Makes Sense 💖

* Free for personal use (hobby projects need love too)
* Paid license for teams (with unlimited users because we're not monsters)
* <u>No subscriptions</u> (your license lasts forever regardless of updates and new features added)
* Built-in user management (no PhD required)

## Who Is This For? 👋

* Solo maintainers who have better things to do than manage servers
* Teams where not everyone speaks fluent Terminal
* Documentation enthusiasts who believe good docs should be easy to maintain
* Anyone who's ever said "I just want to update one page without deploying anything"

## Getting Started 🚀

1. Setup your server - step by step
2. Point and click your way to greatness
3. Actually enjoy managing documentation (plot twist!)
4. Profit???

*Built with ❤️ (and quite a bit of caffeine) using Next.js and the wonderful* [MDXEditor](https://mdxeditor.dev/)*. Special thanks to Anthropic's Claude for helping turn coffee into documentation.*

*P.S. Yes, we know the irony of creating another wiki platform. But sometimes you just have to roll your own, you know?* 😉
