# Theming

The theming panel allows you to customize the visual appearance and navigation structure of your wiki. This includes managing the color theme, header navigation, and footer content.

## Theme Selection

You can choose between three theme modes:

* **Light Mode**: A bright theme suitable for daytime use
* **Dark Mode**: A darker theme that's easier on the eyes in low-light conditions
* **System**: Automatically matches your system's theme preferences

## Header Customization

The header section can be customized with:

* **Header Logo**: Upload a custom logo to display in the header
* **Navigation Links**: Add up to 5 custom navigation links
  * Each link can have a text label and URL
  * Links can be edited or deleted as needed
  * Links will appear in the main navigation bar

## Footer Customization

The footer can be extensively customized with:

* **Footer Logo**: Upload a custom logo to display in the footer
* **Two Column Layout**: Create two columns of links, each with:
  * A custom header text
  * Up to 6 links per column
  * Each link can have a text label and URL
  * Links can be edited or deleted as needed

### Footer Settings (Pro License)

With a Pro license, you get additional footer customization options:

* **Custom Copyright Text**: Add your own copyright message
* **"Powered By" Text**: Option to hide the "Powered by" text

## Managing Links

When adding or editing links in either the header or footer:

1. Click the "Add Link" button in the desired section
2. Enter the link text (what users will see)
3. Enter the URL (where the link goes)
4. Save your changes
5. Use the edit icon to modify existing links
6. Use the delete icon to remove links

## Saving Changes

After making any changes to your theme settings:

1. Click the "Save Theme" button at the top of the panel
2. Wait for the confirmation message
3. Your changes will be applied immediately

Note: The maximum number of links is limited to 5 in the header and 6 per column in the footer to maintain a clean and organized navigation structure.
